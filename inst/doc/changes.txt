This package aims to make SEER and A-bomb data analyses more readily reproducible.

Version 0.01.1     First Draft containing mkSEER, getFields and pickFields 5/27/2012
                   Blood 2012 Figures 4, 5a, 5bc, and 6 as R functions with help.     
                   Fig S4 (cleaned) + Landaw's Dingli code -> scripts in papers folder.  5/28/2012
                   Wrote help and demo files                                   5/29-30/2012
                   Set up separate repository so installation works without submission to CRAN via 
install.packages(c("LaF","RSQLite","bbmle","SEERaBomb"),repos=c("http://cran.cwru.edu/","http://epbi-radivot.cwru.edu/"))   
                   and set up Rnw stubs to get links to static pdfs from "vignettes" of the main help page  5/31/2012
                   Update epbi-radivot.case.edu website for SEERaBomb + test install on ubuntu. Fix all caps 
                   on HEMA87.DAT needed to work on case sensitive linux.                   6/1/2012
                   Submitted to CRAN on 6/17/2012

                   
Version 0.2.1      Added courses directory and into it a script that goes through ~all SEER cancers 
                   versus age, sex and race. Fixed bug in pickFields() of it calling getFields() again
                   And bug of N=N+1 when survtm is picked, and problem of stringsAsFactors in cbind
                   This now allows the following without error
                   (df=getFields())
                   (dff=pickFields(df,picks=df$names))
                   Note that there really does appear to be an empty space after BEHANAL in the dataset, i.e.
                   The following in the sas file is not in error, $char1. below really is $char1. and not $char2.
                   @ 221 ICCC3EXT        $char3.  /* ICCC ICD-O-3 Extended Recode */
 				   @ 224 BEHANAL         $char1.  /* Behavior recode for analysis */
   				   @ 226 HISTREC         $char2.  /* Broad Histology recode */
   				   So the output of pickFields with all fields picked still has one spacer row at row 97, just after BEHANAL
