CHANGES IN VERSION 2013.4.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Now handles SEER data release of April 24, 2013

    o Package version number now matches latest SEER release date.


SIGNIFICANT USER-LEVEL CHANGES

    o No longer handles SEER data released in 2012.

Notes

    o The SEER SAS file changed: fields are no longer a continuum.  
      The implication is that getFields is now field name centric, since 
      I can no longer count on all fields being in the SAS file.
      
    o Survival is now already in months in SEER, so mapping it is no longer needed. 
      Indeed, the SAS file no longer includes a field for survival with years and 
      months as two character strings in a field of 4 chars, though this field does
      still remain in the SEER data files.
